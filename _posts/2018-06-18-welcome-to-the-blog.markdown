__Hi, I'm Andy and I like to Make Stuff__ _(totally stealing Bob's line here!)._

It's mostly true though - my name is Andy and I'm a maker. I hope to use this site to start documenting my efforts to make various things. I love hacking with electronics, especially the Raspberry Pi and Arduino and I've also been known to dabble from time to time with woodworking, DIY, and digital fabrication. I also run a meetup for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts in Amsterdam. Right now I'm also dabbling with the healthy ketogenic "keto" diet. So I may also share some recipes here as well.

I've been procrastincating on the blog building thing for some time. I keep trying to redesign an existing blog based on WordPress and find myself putting it off because it's not what I want to be doing (also, it contains posts from when I was very young and I'm not very proud of some of the content I wrote there). What I want is to be making stuff and sharing my learnings and so instead of messing around, I just threw a site up on Github pages, with the most minimal theme I could find and got something up in minutes instead of weeks!

I'm not really planning anything specific, but I recently learnt the saying __"Ready, Fire, Aim!"__. It means get started on something, and then figure out how to refine it and make it perfect later on, so thats what I'm doing!

Wish me luck on this journey!
